# Snake in Terminal
With such as amazing project like `Textual` it was matter of time when someone would make game with it! So here is my first attempt to start slowly and check possibilities.  

## To start
With `Python` already installed get dependecies:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
and run with:
```
python3 main.py
```

## Keep in mind
This game works in terminal so the render possibilities are limited by your setup. If it looks strange or even ugly be sure that it support color range, and if there are performance issues it also may be caused by badly optimized emulator.
